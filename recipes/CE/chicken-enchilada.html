                Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring 
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 
                8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                Combine enchilada sauce, half-and-half, and green chiles in the same pot over medium heat and cook until warm, 5 to 10 minutes. 
                Slowly add Cheddar cheese and pepperjack cheese and whisk continuously until melted, about 5 minutes. Return cooked macaroni to the pot. 
                Add chicken and cilantro and stir until combined and heated through, about 5 minutes more.
