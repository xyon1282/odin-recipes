            <li>1 cup superfine sugar</li>
            <li>1(10 ounce) can red enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 large eggs eggs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ⅜ cups self-rising flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soft margarine, or as needed</li>
            <li>5 ounces fresh raspberries</li>
            <li>⅜ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>3 drops lemon juice, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Grease an 8x4-inch loaf tin with soft margarine and set aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cream superfine sugar and butter together with a paddle attachment 
                of a free-standing electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until just mixed; do not over-whisk. Beat gradually into the butter mixture until well incorporated. 
                Sift in flour and baking powder, bit by bit, folding after each addition. Set batter aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                Puree raspberries, confectioners' sugar, and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth. 
                Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Separate half of the cake mix into a different bowl and stir the coulis through.
            </li>

            <li>
                Put alternating dollops of the raspberry and vanilla batters into the prepared loaf tin using a small ice cream scoop. 
                Swirl both sets of dollops together slightly using the blunt end of a skewer. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the top of the cake is golden brown and risen and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. 
                Let cool in the tin for 5 to 10 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges of the tin and remove the cake, leaving to cool completely on a wire rack.
            </li>


        </ol>
