        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add chow mein noodles and cook over medium heat until cooked through 
                but still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.

            <li>

                Add shrimp and cook and stir until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 5 minutes. Add consomme, celery, and salt; cook, covered, for 5 minutes. 
                Add bean sprouts and mushrooms and bring to a simmer.
            </li>

            <li>
                Blend water, cornstarch, soy sauce, and sugar together in a small bowl. 
                Add mixture to the pot and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve over cooked chow mein noodles.
